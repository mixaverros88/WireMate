## What is WireMate?

WireMate is the full backoffice that teams keep wishing WireMock came with a UI, a persistence layer, and a management API on top of WireMock. Instead of editing JSON stub files by hand, engineers and QA testers work inside a single web app where every mock has a name, a description, while a Spring Boot backend stores every stub in PostgreSQL and keeps the running WireMock server in sync.

Every stub is persisted to PostgreSQL and grouped into **projects**, so a "Payment Gateway" mock set and an "Order Service" mock set never collide. From the same UI, you can **browse live WireMock stubs** and **search the logs** with analytics charts.

The goal is simple: give WireMock a UI that the whole team can use to manage stubs and spin up reliable test environments in seconds.

### Who it's for

- **Backend engineers** who want to stop maintaining stub JSON in a shared Postman collection.
- **QA and integration testers** who need to fake downstream services on demand.

### What makes it different

- **Everything is persisted.** Unlike a bare WireMock server.
- **Projects, not folders.** Organise stubs the way you think about them by service, by feature, by team.
- **Sync awareness.** A background task continuously diffs your database against the live WireMock server and surfaces drift in the notifications panel.
- **One place for everything.** Mocks, active stubs, logs, near misses, and server health all live in the same UI.

## Features

- **Visual Mock Builder** — Create request/response mappings through an intuitive form: methods, URLs, headers, JSON bodies, delays, and descriptions.
- **Project Management** — Organise mocks into projects with search and filtering across your entire workspace.
- **WireMock Stubs Viewer** — Browse all active stub mappings on your WireMock server. Filter by method, search by URL, and preview responses in real time.
- **Logs with Analytics** — Inspect every request WireMock receives (matched and unmatched) with live charts for method distribution, status codes, and request volume over time.
- **State Control** — Monitor server health and perform admin operations from a single dashboard.
- **Clone & Move** — Duplicate any mock in one click, or transfer mocks between projects as your needs evolve.
- **Postman Import / JSON Export** — Bring existing collections in and export any project for versioning or sharing.
- **Sync Delta Notifications** — A background task detects differences between the database and WireMock and surfaces them in-app.
- **One-Click Publish** — Push stubs directly to any WireMock server. Go from draft to live mock in seconds.
- **Dark & Light Theme** — Switch between dark and light modes; every view adapts seamlessly.
- **Persistent Storage** — All mappings are persisted to PostgreSQL. Never lose a stub.
- **Docker-Ready** — Spin up the entire stack with Docker Compose in one command.

## How It Works

1. **Create a project** — Group your stubs by project. Stay organised from day one.
2. **Build your stubs** — Use the UI to define requests, responses, delays, and headers.
3. **Publish to WireMock** — Publish instantly. All stubs are persisted in the database.
4. **Monitor & debug** — Search through the logs to inspect incoming requests and debug your stubs.

## Tech Stack

**Backend** — Java 25, Spring Boot 4.1.0, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL 17, Maven

**Frontend** — Vue 3.5, TypeScript 6.0, Vite 8, Tailwind CSS 4

**Infrastructure** — Docker & Docker Compose, Nginx, WireMock 3.13.2

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker

### Run with Docker Compose

The compose file pulls the backend and UI images,  so you don't need to build anything locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mixaverros88/WireMate.git
cd WireMate
docker compose up -d
```
## This starts

**UI** at http://localhost:9002/

**WireMate** at http://localhost:9001/

**WireMock** at http://localhost:9000/

**PostgreSQL** at localhost:5432
